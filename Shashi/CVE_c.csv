 48,CVE-2021-34784,79,,Exec Code XSS ,2021-11-04,2021-11-06,3.5,None,Remote,Medium,???,None,Partial,None,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."
 49,CVE-2021-34783,20,,DoS ,2021-10-27,2021-10-29,7.8,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Complete,"A vulnerability in the software-based SSL/TLS message handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL/TLS decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Datagram TLS (DTLS) messages cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability."

The attacker must have valid device credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on API endpoints. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about other users who are configured with higher privileges on the application."
