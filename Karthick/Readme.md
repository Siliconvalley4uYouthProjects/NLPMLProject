Hi! This is Karthick! Checkout below to see my progress!!

**CVE data extraction from cve.mitre.org**
* cve-allitems.csv - contains all the CVE IDs from CVRF-XML format available in https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems-cvrf.xml.
* Generate cve-allitems.csv.py - python script used to extract the data and convert it to CSV (Changes can be made to the script to add or modify more columns).
* CVE-Search.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with practice use of Ares (Package) to extarct data and a dummy model developed on the extracted data for testing and some fun :)

**CVE data extraction using cve-search**
cve-search github: https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search
Date-updated -- 2022-02-27--will update a documentation to get the cve data to mongodb later!
* CVE-Search data from MongoDB using Pymongo.ipynb - connect to MongoDB using Pymongo and get the data and build a NLP model based on keywords
